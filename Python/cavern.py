"""
How many distinct chambers in the cavern?

Author: David Gustafson
cavern.py: CIS 210, assignment 4, Winter 2014
Determines the number of distinct chambers in a grid representation of 
a cavern by flood-filling each discovered air pocket. 

Usage:  python3 cavern.py cavedesc.txt

Requires grid.py, graphics.py  (for displaying cavern as grid of cells)
