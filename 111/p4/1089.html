<h1>Number Puzzler</h1>
<p> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert Einstein used to take great
delight in baffling friends with this puzzle.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, write the number 1089 on a piece of paper, fold it, and hand it to a friend for safekeeping. 
What you wrote down is not to be read until you have completed your amazing mental feat. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Next, ask your friend to write down any three-digit number, emphasizing that the first and last 
digits must differ by at least two. Close your eyes or turn your back while this is being done. 
 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After your friend has written down the three-digit number, ask your friend to reverse it, then subtract the smaller from the larger. 
<b>Example: 654 - 456 = 198.</b>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once this is done, tell your friend to reverse the new number. 
<b>Example: 198 becomes 891.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Next ask your friend to add the new number and its reverse together. 
<b>Example: 198 + 891 = 1089.</b>
<br><br>
If all goes as planned, your friend will be amazed. The number you wrote down at the start -- 
1089 -- will always be the same as the end result of this mathematical trick.
